# Sales-analysis-sql
End-to-end Sales Analysis project using MySQL with real-world schema, foreign keys, and business insights.
# Sales Analysis using SQL (MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Sales Analysis system built using MySQL.
It simulates a real-world business database and focuses on extracting meaningful business insights using SQL.

The project demonstrates database design, data integrity using foreign keys, and analytical SQL queries used in real Data Analyst roles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- PopSQL
- GitHub

---

## 🗂️ Database Design
The database is designed using relational modeling and consists of five tables:

- customers  
- products  
- orders  
- order_items  
- payments  

Foreign key constraints are used to maintain referential integrity between tables.
